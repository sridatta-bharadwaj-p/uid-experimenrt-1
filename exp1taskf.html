        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
        </p>
        
        <p style = "text-align : right;">
        HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
        </p>
        
        <p style = "text-align : center;">
        It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
